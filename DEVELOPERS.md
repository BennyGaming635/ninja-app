# Developers
***
This code is fully open-source so you can add features and do what-ever you want!
For testing your code, you can use AppLogger which is built into the app, all you need to do is just import AppLogger.
```dart
import '../utils/app_logger.dart';
```
and to report something to AppLogger you use this;
```dart
AppLogger.log('No passwords found in storage.');
```
(This tells AppLogger that no passwords were found in storage).
***
## Extension Support?
In the future extension support will be added which allows for open-source extensions to be added to the app, which can integrate with the logging service.
***
## Whats AppLogger?
AppLogger is a service made originally for Ninja (The app) to help log problems within the app. Now it's avaliable to help **you** make your next big change. To make AppLogger better for your privacy, it **never** shares any data with anyone else, except you.
While logs are recorded with developer mode off but are always deleted within the day to keep your data safe*.

*Not avaliable on all devices.
